# Visualising Proteins

Recently I've been doing a lot of structural bioinformatics. 
To avoid having to export my results into PyMol of Chimerax, I wanted a better solution 
that could embed the results more easily into the report that I was writing. 

What would be even better than just an image of the final result is a fully interactive 3D model
of the protein I was analysing at the time. Packages to achieve a similar sort of impact were already available in the form of [3Dmol.js](http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/), but it wasn't easy to embed or create
through the R interface. 

I now humbly present, an (early) version of [{r3dmol}](https://swsoyee.github.io/r3dmol/articles/r3dmol.html)!

Play around with the widget below, which can be generated in just a couple of lines of code, and embedded in an `rmarkdown` document or in the RStudio viewer pane.

```{r}
# install.packages("r3dmol")
r3dmol::m_glimpse('4ozs') |> 
  r3dmol::m_spin()
```


Check the Twitter thread for more details, but now while still in the Rstudio IDE, you can create 
molecular visualisations to quickly preview your work, but more importantly, you can seamlessly embed them into _Rmarkdown_ HTML reports for sharing with colleagues or blogging online.
