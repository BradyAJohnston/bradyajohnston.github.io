A couple of months ago I ran (with lots of help for content) an R for biologists workshop.

It was aimed at wet lab biologists and biochemists who hadn't done much coding before. R is a fantastic language
for doing statistical analysis, making _beautiful_ graphics and visualising very complex datasets.
I highly recommend it. A lot of people say the syntax is quirky (it _is_) but once you get the hang of it,
you won't regret.

The original working document for the tuturial was [here](https://hackmd.io/@MHhGW58bTWa4L74DCRvYcQ/ryxemkVKI/edit), but I thought
I might just include all of it directly on my blog as it was all written in `markdown` anyway.

Below is the contents of the workshop, along with video recordings of the sessions:

## Class 1 - R / Rstudio Installation
R version 4.0 has just been released! This is very exciting (for a number of nerdy reasons) but in this course we will be using R version 3.6.3 (you can use some version of 3.6.x) to keep things consistent with the materials.



#### Installing `R` and `Rstudio`
There is a great guide on how to download and install R if you haven't already, than can be found [here](https://plavskin.github.io/Intro_R_Course/Workshop_1.nb.html#downloading-installing-and-navigating-rstudio). If you get lost try following [this one](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu) instead.

Rstudio is not much use to you without R installed, and using R without Rstudio is a lot more effort than it is worth. Ensure that you have both installed, and that Rstudio boots up.

If you didn't save have success with making a function to make the plants grow, use the example one below:
```{R}
grow_plants <- function(df, dog, growth_amount, sd){

  growth_heights = rnorm(n = 3, mean = growth_amount * dog, sd = sd)

  new_df_values <- data.frame(
    day = rep(dog, 3),
    height = growth_heights,
    plant.id = LETTERS[1:3]
  )

  output_df <- rbind(df, new_df_values)

  return(output_df)
}
```
