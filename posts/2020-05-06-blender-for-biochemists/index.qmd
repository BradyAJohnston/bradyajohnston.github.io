I've started my journey into the realm of youtube.

After promising people at multiple conferences that I might start doing some tutorials on how to get into the very exciting if very intimidating world of 3D modelling, I've finally made the plung.

Maybe one day in a far off land (likely while I procrastinate writing my thesis) I will also write up accompanying documentation for how to achieve various looks and techniques (and some standards for importing / exporting 3D models).
For now though there is only the youtube versions.

You can view the results below, and be sure to *like and subscribe* and all that as well.
