This hasn't been the first attempt at bringing molecular data sets into Blender, but I blieve it has so far been the most successful.
In a very short summary, we can think of atoms and molecules as a collection of vertices and edges.
Blender knows how to handle vertices and edges. Once we have the data inside of Blender (along with a large number of 'molecular' attributes for points and edges) then the full power of Geometry Nodes is at our fingertips for molecular visualisation.

## Install as a python package?

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
<!-- will only appear in slides -->
- Also built and distributed via [`pypi.org`](https://pypi.org/p/molecularnodes)

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
> It's less likely than you'd think!

Creating an add-on for Blender that can also be built and shipping as a python package was quite the task. 
It leads to a variety of problems and strange engineering issues that come with writing code for Blender that a 'regular' python package wouldn't have to deal with. 

Covering that topic with all of our learnings would be a massive blog post itself. 
The short version is that you can install molecularnodes from [`pypi`](https://pypi.org/p/molecularnodes) and use if for molecular rendering in python scripts of jupyter notebooks like this one.

:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-dna
#| fig-cap: X-ray crystallography structure of a fragment of DNA.
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: "|3-8|10-11|13-14|"
# !pip install bpy molecularnodes

import molecularnodes as mn
canvas = mn.Canvas(
    engine=mn.scene.Cycles(samples=16),
    resolution=(1280, 720),
    transparent=True
    )

mol = mn.Molecule.fetch("1BNA")
mol.add_style("vdw")

canvas.frame_view(mol, (3.14, 3.14 / 2, 0))
canvas.snapshot()
```

## [`databpy`](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/databpy)

- 'numpy-like' interfaces to attributes on objects

```{.py code-line-numbers="|1-2|4-5|7-9|11-18|"}
# set the x component for the first 10 verts to 1.0
obj["position"][:10, 0] = 1.0 

# add 1 to x, 2 to y, 3 to z component of position
obj["position"] += np.array([1, 2, 3]) 

# infers data types for storage and retrieval
obj["att_name"] = np.zeros(len(obj), dypte=int)
obj["att_name"] 

# get and set attributes on non-point domains
obj.store_named_attribute(
  data=np.zeros((len(bob), 4, 4), dtype=float),
  name="a_matrix",
  domain=db.AttributeDomains.FACE
  )
obj.named_attribute()
```

:::: {.fragment}
- Not paid at all, just benefited a lot from using it
::::
:::: {.fragment}
- Other platforms offer similar (CodeBerg etc.) I just have experience with GitHub
::::
:::: {.fragment}
- Free file hosting (within 'reason')
::::
:::: {.fragment}
- Free compute for automated testing and deployment (public projects)
::::

- Increased visibility [(>1,000 ⭐️!)]{.fragment}[(not guaranteed)]{.fragment}

## Building & Distributing MN

## Building & Distributing MN

- Run tests against different versions of Blender (including daily builds)
- Run tests against `bpy` installed via `pip` for automated pipelines
- Download and bundle `.whl` files with extension
- Upload extension to GitHub & Extensions platform

## Breaking 5.0 Changes

Tests are run daily on MacOS, Windows & Linux against the latest alpha builds from Blender.

- `bpy.data.materials.new()` starts with empty node tree (not BSDF + Output) [#980](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/980)

These were some of the recent changes that were breaking the add-on but automated testing alterted us and we were able to fix it quickly. When 5.0 is released as long as we keep fixing the problems as they appear we can be confident that it will work day-of. 

Fixing individual errors as they appear is also _much_ easier to debug than testing once the beta releases happen (or worse the final release) where multiple failures might pile up on top of each other.

# Distributing on GitHub

## 'Old School'
::: {.fragment}
- have your add-on be 'top-level' on GitHub - users just download the `.zip` of the repo and install
:::
::: {.fragment}
  - Never clear when updates are out or what version is 'released'
:::
::: {.fragment}
- package up `.zip` and create a GitHub release - users download from release page and check back for updates
:::
::: {.fragment}
  - Clearer which version is currently released, requires users to manually update
:::
## Hip & New and Cool and Fresh with 'Extensions'
::: {.fragment}
- Host an `index.json` somewhere accessible on the network which points to files, allows automatic updates
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Host an `index.json` and files all on GitHub
  - Simple index for single add-on on a single repo
  - A repo that indexes and builds multiple add-ons from multiple sources

## Your Personal Extensions Repo
::: {.fragment}
- Build and release add-ons on GitHub (through automations!) in their own repos
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Compile multiple add-ons in a single subscribeable repo
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Users add 'your personal repo' - they get updates just like they would from the official Extensions platform

## How is it Built?

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
<!-- will only appear in blogpost -->
We can use GitHub actions (or another similar service) to compile 'released' add-ons from multiple different services into a single extenion repo. 

Importantly we need Blender to run checksum on the actual files that your users will download before publishing the `index.json`. We don't host or serve the actual files ourselves, those remain on at the original publishing locations (the release pages of the individual repos). We just generate an index that points to those locations.
