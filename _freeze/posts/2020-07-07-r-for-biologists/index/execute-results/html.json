R is a fantastic language\nfor doing statistical analysis, making _beautiful_ graphics and visualising very complex datasets.\nI highly recommend it. A lot of people say the syntax is quirky (it _is_) but once you get the hang of it,\nyou won't regret.\n\nThe original working document for the tuturial was [here](https://hackmd.io/@MHhGW58bTWa4L74DCRvYcQ/ryxemkVKI/edit), but I thought\nI might just include all of it directly on my blog as it was all written in `markdown` anyway.\n\nBelow is the contents of the workshop, along with video recordings of the sessions:\n\n\n## R for Biologists Workshop\n\nThis document will contain relevant links, information, and allow us to quickly and collaboratively share code with good formatting.\n\nBrady's Twitter: [@bradyajohnston](https://twitter.com/bradyajohnston)\n\n#### **Zoom Info**\n* Zoom link: https://uwa.zoom.us/j/94747101358?pwd=V0NqQ1dJaW1sU0J5ZVIyV0Rta0huQT09\n* Zoom password: 546735\n\n#### **Course outline and info:**\n[Web outline here](https://plavskin.github.io/Intro_R_Course/)\n\n[Download all files here:](https://github.com/plavskin/Intro_R_Course)\n\n[Rstudio Cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)\n\n[Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n\n#### Anonymous Feedback form:\nhttps://forms.gle/7uuEMs47SuK5Nsm56\n\n#### Session recordings:\nIf any of these don't work, send me an email.\nSession:\n1.

Just a brief bio about research you do, coding experience you might have etc.\n\nHello, I'm Soodeh\n\nHey guys, Heidar here\nHi I am Federica from Milan, Italy :)\n\n\nHi Brady, thanks for the workshop! Kalia\n\n\nI am Paula (Pau VT), from Germany, but originally from Chile\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\n**Hello! My name is Brady, and I am from Perth, australia. It is nice to have you all here!**\n\nHello Brady\n\n\nHi everyone, this is Sam, I'm from Perth WA.\n\nHello all! I'm Callum and I'm from Perth Aus!\n\nHello, my name is Ayeisha and I am also from Perth, Australia.\n\nHello, My name is Khyati and am from India.\n\nG'day, my name is James, currently in Perth.\n\n\nHello, my name is Alessio and I am from Lombardy, Italy\n\nHello! I'm Jacob - from Perth, Australia.\n\nHi I'am Julie Mallet, from France\n\nHi everyone, my name is Giada, I'm from Italy!\n\n\n## Class 1 - R / Rstudio Installation\nR version 4.0 has just been released! This is very exciting (for a number of nerdy reasons) but in this course we will be using R version 3.6.3 (you can use some version of 3.6.x) to keep things consistent with the materials.\n\n\n\n#### Installing `R` and `Rstudio`\nThere is a great guide on how to download and install R if you haven't already, than can be found [here](https://plavskin.github.io/Intro_R_Course/Workshop_1.nb.html#downloading-installing-and-navigating-rstudio). If you get lost try following [this one](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu) instead.\n\nRstudio is not much use to you without R installed, and using R without Rstudio is a lot more effort than it is worth. Ensure that you have both installed, and that Rstudio boots up.\n\n#### Try setting up your screen like this, in order to follow along.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P48LUXi.jpg)\n\n\nDownloading the R-markdown document for the first session [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/etpexuvc4vpiiz9/AACtRwfd8iBDvHhq_p-CGKWza?dl=0).\n\n## Class 2 - Variables, types and functions.\n\n[Download second file here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/003hdg5gj29sfnp/Workshop_2.Rmd?dl=0)\n\n### Let's talk about variables and functions.\n\n\n## Class 3 - Intro to Vectors\n[Class 3 Files.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gz7fh11heib933z/Workshop_3.Rmd?dl=0)\n\nPosting of code:\n\n## Class 4 - Logical Operations\n\n[Link to files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pt63nktr3hjuk7n/Workshop_4.Rmd?dl=0)\n\n\n## Class 5 - Dataframes!\n[Linke to files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzdf4fwwrgegkhw/Workshop_5.Rmd?dl=0)\n\n[Link to iris files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8t66gfyi60dc8zp/iris.csv?dl=0)\n\n## Class 6 - Plotting your data with ggplot2.\n\nIf you haven't download the files [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbqcvyv8s0x31qw/Workshop_6.Rmd?dl=0):\n\nLet's start posting out plots.\n\n## Class 7\nIf you have not downloaded files, download here:\n\n[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/swukoel23ofei09/Workshop_7.Rmd?dl=0)\n\n## Class 8: Programming with R | Part 1\n\nPrograaming with R.\n\nFiles [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lzr2mr1sq8p1vla/Workshop_8.Rmd?dl=0)\n\n## Class 9: Programming with R | Part 2\n\nFiles available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cklocisi9exkuli/Workshop_9.Rmd?dl=0).\n\nIf you didn't save have success with making a function to make the plants grow, use the example one below:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrow_plants <- function(df, dog, growth_amount, sd){\n\n  growth_heights = rnorm(n = 3, mean = growth_amount * dog, sd = sd)\n\n  new_df_values <- data.frame(\n    day = rep(dog, 3),\n    height = growth_heights,\n    plant.id = LETTERS[1:3]\n  )\n\n  output_df <- rbind(df, new_df_values)\n\n  return(output_df)\n}\n```\n:::\n",
