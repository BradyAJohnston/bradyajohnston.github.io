I'm Brady and I'm a (very close to finishing) PhD student, working on novel RNA binding proteins using structural biology and biophysics.
I have a passion for compelling data visualisation of complex topics, usually in biology.

I'm a self-taught and devout R coder, committed to improving the speed, accuracy and reproducibility of basic wet-lab research and it's analysis.
I currently have two packages available for download from CRAN, and a couple more on the way - check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bradyajohnston) for details.

I'm also a self-taught 3D artist using [Blender](https://blender.org) for visualisation of proteins, and I teach other interested biochemists over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/bradyjohnston).
